The final output of the project is a web system with backend deployed on Heroku, APIs and ML model hosted on flask and frontend hosted on Repl.it. The landing page gives users the choice to either input equipment or do an image search with the equipment they have. Next, if they prefer to do an image search, the system gives them the feedback if it is able to recognize the equipment from the image. Users can select multiple equipment by repeatedly typing or uploading images.
